What's coming:
- Hugging players
- Improved fly, bypasses anticheat
- More commands such as headbang, etc.

Infinite Yield Remastered is a better version of the default IY, as it will include more commands and features and improved commands. It will also include a smoother cleaner UI, but as this is still being worked on, it is only in beta.
Credits to the original IY devs for the source code.
